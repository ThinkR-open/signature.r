This is the R version of the [`{signature.py}`](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/signature.py) and [`{signature.js}`](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/signature.js) application.

This application provides a graphical interface to streamline the creation and maintenance of your email signature.

No more wrestling with images or getting tangled up in HTML code; the application offers a set of fields to update your signature easily.

Simply enter your name, first name, email, and other necessary information to populate your signature.

Additionally, the application allows you to copy the HTML code with a single button click, making it easy to paste into your email client settings.

Lastly, updating the banner (the image at the bottom of the signature) and the associated link for redirection is straightforward. You no longer need to request everyone to update their signature individually for these changes.

## Demo

üïπÔ∏è Try the app at:
[signature-r-psi.vercel.app/](https://signature-r-psi.vercel.app/)


## Try locally

1. Install the package from GitHub:

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ThinkR-open/signature.r")
```

2. Run the app:

```{r eval=FALSE}
signature.r::run_app()
```

or clone the repository and run the app:

1. Clone the repository

2. Run the app:

```{r eval=FALSE}
renv::restore()
pkgload::load_all()
golem::run_dev()
```

## Modify the theme

This app uses Bootstrap `5.3.3`.

To modify the theme, edit the `inst/app/signature.scss` file.

Every time you run `golem::run_dev()`, the `signature.scss` file is compiled into `inst/app/www/signature.css`.

## How the redirection banner works?

The redirection banner is a JavaScript function that redirects the user to the specified URL.

To modify the redirection URL, creeate a `index.html` file at the root of the project.

See : [signature](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/signature/)

## Deployment

This application is deployed on Connect. 

But also serverless directly with ShinyLive : 

```{r eval=FALSE}
shinylive::export(".", "site")
httpuv::runStaticServer("site/")
```
